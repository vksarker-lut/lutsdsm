## Description: 
### 'Learner Kid' is an android application for kids to learn about alphabet, fruits and vegetables.


Upon launching the application, the application shows the menu in which 'Alphabet',
'Five Fruits' and 'Five Vegetables' are shown. An user can select one of the options 
and the application shows the further details of that option. For example, the alphabet
option shows the English alphabet in full, the vowels and the consonents for easy learning.
The 'Mathematics' option opens up a calculator-like page in which an user can enter two 
numbers to perform four different operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) 
just by pressing the buttons. A 'divide by zero' check is also included to prevent the 
application from unintetional crashing. 
The 'Five Fruits' option displays a list of five common fruits in a customised list view.
In addition, it also shows a small description and an image of individual fruits.
Similarly, for the 'Five Vegetables' option provides a list of five commonly used
vegetables along with its short description and a preview image.
